/**
 * Enumeration class ShipState - This enum handles all possible states a ship can be in
 * 
 * The four states are:
 * - RESERVE: When the ship is in the reserve fleet, not yet commissioned.
 * - ACTIVE: When the ship is part of the squadron and available for encounters.
 * - RESTING: When the ship has fought a battle and is temporarily inactive.
 * - SUNK: When the ship has been destroyed and cannot be used again.
 * 
 * This enum is Serializable, allowing it to be saved and loaded along with game state.
